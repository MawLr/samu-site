How unique are the Afrikaners? - Part One

The Afrikaner people are likely well aware of the uniqueness of their situation. President Jacob Zuma once stated that the Afrikaners are Africa’s “only white tribe”, and the only ones who are “truly African”. As of now, this is true. But Zuma ignores the fact that there were once other white tribes on the continent. Concerningly, all have been expelled by their home nations. The Rhodesians during Mugabe’s rule, the Portuguese from Angola and Mozambique after the Carnation Revolution, and even the Pied Noir of Algeria post-civil war, all had found themselves unwelcome in their own homes after the onset of majority rule. They were perhaps the Afrikaner’s closest compatriots on the continent, though now the Afrikaner finds himself alone among the European-descended groups that can truly call Africa home. The pain of the Afrikaner is now unique to the world.
Despite this solitude, this begs the question as to whether other ethnic groups in the world share the Afrikaner’s situation. This series will shed some light on other groups who by luck, may find some empathy for the Afrikaner due to facing similar circumstances. Namely, this article series will focus on groups that are political minorities in their homelands, are envied by the majority population in their nations, and face an uncertain future.

Caldoches are known for their affinity for guns

While no group currently shares a similarly precarious situation to the Afrikaners, the first group to be examined may be the most similar. These are the Caldoches of New Caledonia, and the subject of the first article. The Caldoches are a White French-speaking people who inhabit the Polynesian territory of New Caledonia. While New Caledonia is still under French rule, this tropical island is given a high level of autonomy in its affairs. Its regional political situation is split down the middle between the indigenous Kanaks who favor independence, and the Caldoches (with some Kanak allies) who oppose independence. Ironically, it may be noted that Kanaks and other Melanesian groups bear a physical resemblance to Bantus, though this similarity is coincidental and not indicative of any close genetic affinity between the two groups.
The Caldoches make up 24% of the island territory’s population, though they make up a bare majority in the capital Nouméa. While most of them had come to the islands as farmers, economic troubles led many of them to move into the main city. However, Caldoches still feel a connection to their land, and many of them still own rural properties which their families have owned for generations. While they still consider themselves Frenchmen, they set themselves apart from temporary migrants from the mainland, who they call “Zoreilles” (translating to “ears”, meaning unclear). Caldoches are mainly French in origin, though some are of German, British, Irish, or even Malay descent. Most of their ancestors came in various waves of settler migration during the late 1800s, building infrastructure on the island and setting up farms where they raised cattle and poultry.  Kanaks and Caldoches share a mutual distrust which stems from a violent insurgency against the colonial regime during the 1970s and 80s, which finally ended in agreement in 1988 to devolve further power to local government, and an agreement to renegotiate devolution and set a future referendum on the island’s status ten years later.
After this next agreement set the terms of territorial power, the French government and the Kanak rebels agreed on a referendum to be set another 20 years later, in 2018. This referendum had barely lost (57%-43%) due to a lack of funding on the independence campaign. A second referendum conducted later had narrowed the gap to 53%-47%. A third referendum was set to be held in 2021, but it conveniently failed after coronavirus lockdowns disrupted pro-independence campaigners. By luck, the Caldoches seem to remain unmolested. 
Kanak birth rates, while higher than Europeans, are counteracted by continual migration from mainland France. Unlike the Afrikaners, the Caldoches are blessed to have a benefactor in Europe, and demographics on their side. However, in contrast to Afrikaners, this fact also means that in the case of independence, they may be as likely to flee to France as the Pied Noir. However, unlike the Pied Noir, they are armed to the teeth, and willing to defend their homes if independence is forced on them. Their demographics (with 24% of the population), may also make attempts to dispossess them less likely than if their numbers were fewer.
