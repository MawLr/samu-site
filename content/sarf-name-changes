## South African Reserve Force Name Changes

Three years ago the ANC , in keeping with their tradition of changing the names of failing things rather than fixing them, began a campaign of name changes for the South African Reserve Force. Some of the name changes include the Cape Town Rifles to the Chief Langalibalele Rifles, the South African Irish Regiment is now the Andrew Mlangeni Regiment, and Regiment West Province is now Regiment Jan Smuts. 

The stated goal of the name changes is to make the Reserve Force’s units reflect South Africa’s martial tradition as a whole, not just the martial tradition of its English speaking population but also the traditions of the black population. But the reality of this name change, like all name changes in this country, is that it was done to cover up a failing institution and further marginalize the nation’s English and Indian population. By changing the traditions and names of these units it further disincentives English and Indian men from participating in the military even in the part time capacity of the reserves. 

The Reserve Forces name change is also indicative of another ANC theme. That is when they can’t build something good on their own they must just rename something that is already good and inevitably destroy what was once good. 

Luckily there is one ray of hope, most of the units set to change their names have yet to do so officially and the deadline has already passed. Also the Cape Town Highlanders has successfully refused its name change to the Gonnema Regiment and according to an official announcement it will remain the Cape Town Highlanders. This successful resistance against the name change shows that we can combat all name changes by refusing to use these new names that don’t belong to what they are attached to.
