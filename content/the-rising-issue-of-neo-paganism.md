## What is neo-paganism?

Paganism can run by many definitions depending on the orientations of the practitioner. Our 
intentions have no basis in attacking a specific group of pagans, but obviously we will dictate our 
gripes with the phenomenon from a Germanic and Nationalist perspective.

Neo-paganism is an attempt to return to the "origins" of our Germanic heritage, to follow the "old 
ways". We can't consolidate this with the reality that our favoured ancestors have been Christians, 
ranging back to the genesis of the Boer in the year 1488 when Vasco da Gama first arrived in the 
Western Cape and announced our hallowed promised land to Europe. More recently, our fathers 
fought under a cross in Angola, our grandfathers under a cross in the Maritz Rebellion and our great 
grandfathers under a cross in the second Anglo-Boer war. Our dearest and sincerest Boer heroes 
were *therefore unequivocally Christian.*

### Neo-paganism and racialism

The "roots" of our forefathers versus our ethnic and historic reality is that our immediate ancestors 
were not pagans, they abhorred anything non-Christian to the point of fanaticism. There reigns a 
conception, fully reinforced by politically neoliberal individuals and institutions, that a type of 
spiritual molestation was forced upon our Germanic forebears by the Christian missionaries of 
Rome, yet somehow it is, perhaps willingly, difficult to grasp to these individuals that their families 
all converted willingly to Christianity because their pagan cults were perceived as inferior.

Take Scandinavian paganism for example: the gods are destined to die in Ragnarök, all of those 
"great warriors" who are carried to Valhalla will lose. Christ is presented as a God of the end times 
who brings destruction to the world to establish his eternal Majesty, whereas Odin is eaten by Fenrir 
and Freyr will be killed by the fire jötunn Surtr. Paganism was a cult of defeatism and for all the 
military glorification of Valhalla and The Place of Many Seats, Freyja's realm of Folkvangr, these 
places were only a marshalling ground preceding the eternal victory of Fenrir and the Giants over 
the gods and humanity.

After Ragnarök two surviving humans will carry the species to a remade new world, after hiding in 
the world tree Yggdrasil, arguably negating everything we do in life as pointless unless we have a 
direct connection to those new pioneers of humanity and their survival. The vast majority of us, our 
art, our struggles, our wars, our passions will have no presence in the new reality entered by our 
species. Ironically, this too runs its naturally course as that cycle of existence will meet a similar end, 
once again negating everything humanity has done to a period of fresh beginning. We are reminded 
that in Hinduism an infinite number of Brahmas have died, with the birth of each being marked with 
the generation of thousands of universes. All universes are sucked in with the inhalation of Vishnu. 
The infinite cycle of existence presents us with a pointless, nihilistic world where we are both all in 
existence and one link in an infinite chain of worlds, as irrelevant as a grain of sand in all the deserts 
of the earth.

For all the racial purity designated to the gods for their European origin, the root creation of the 
gods and the giants, who had many children between them, was unconditionally different. Prior to 
the killing of Ymir by Odin, Vili and Ve he had first been the progenitor of the race of Giants. Despite 
being male, Ymir birthed the first frost giants from between his armpits and he begat a six headed 
being from between his legs. The gods were first birthed when Auðumbla licked a particular frost 
patch which uncovered the first god Buri. Clearly the gods and Giants therefore had no connection 
to their conception and were not of the same race, never mind the same species, yet many gods 
took giants to wife. An example of this is Odin, whose mother was a frost Giant (Jötunn) while his 
father, Borr, had curiously been a god. 

Pertaining to Ragnarök, our ancestors converted because paganism offered them nothing but secure eternal death. 
The latter certainly won't make a neo-pagan individual complacent, since in most cases we perceive that there 
exists no doctrinal ontology to their pantheon of gods. Atheism, or Jungian philosophizing with archetypes and folkish 
poetizing tend to supersede an actual pagan soteriology. There is also the case of European neo-pagans being 
heavily influenced by Hinduism, which reaches such a point of contradiction that the utter 
redundancy of debate meets its predictable conclusion.

Are we supposed to believe that our neo-pagan colleagues "favor ethnic religions", or advocate for 
"blood and soil" and the like, but yet can borrow the faith of India? Would our hyper Calvinist great 
grandparents truly appreciate communing our faith with that of India, and our forefathers who 
fought at Bloor River, Majuba and the battle of Spioen Kop in particular? Could these faiths perhaps 
be our roots, and those roots that carried our families on the great trek in particular?

### Where did these ideas come from?

In Afrikaans, the word “afgod” is synonymous with the worst and most perverse conceptions that 
could designate the practices and orientations of the hearts of men, equating our spiritual heritage 
with what is essentially anathema to the vast majority of our people under the merciless assertation 
that this is somehow more congruent with that exact same people is quite frankly the antithesis of 
Nationalism. A nationalist represents his people, he shares their pain, their desires and their faith. If 
you went to the average Afrikaner and told him to dance around a wooden totem pole or whatever 
eldritch ritual appeals to your fantasies they would offer a negative response, and that is the root 
irony of paganism. One cannot be a nationalist and present ideas that the Nation, the Volk, abhors.

Another commonly heard reason as to why some men turn to these groups or confessions is that 
they point the blame of current world affairs on Christianity. "The evil Christian does not respect 
nature", they claim, or they say that "the evil Christian destroys heritage and civilization". These 
claims are completely ridiculous, Christianity was not at all a catalyst for any industrial revolution, on 
the other hand the very reason why we know about these pagan beliefs, customs and way of life is 
because Christian monks took the time to write them down. Neo-pagans owe their knowledge to the 
very thing they loathe, lest they turn to the Hindu scriptures for absolution.

It should also be noted that neopaganism does not offer a logically coherent worldview and steals 
from the Christian worldview, this article will explain why it’s important to have a logically coherent 
worldview and why neopagans steal from the Christian worldview when it comes to logic and 
morality. There are quite a few laws of logic but one of the most important ones is the Law of 
Contradiction. To summarize the Law of Contradiction teaches that A can’t be A and B at the same 
time, for example I can’t hold a phone and not hold my phone in my hand at the same time. Each 
word in a sentence thus has a specific meaning attached to it which can’t be ignored, when I say
“There is a cat”, I’m not saying “Blue ants eat chips”. Why this would matter is that without a sound 
basis for the law of logic no intelligible discourse can be had at all. Christianity provides a basis for 
this while neo-paganism doesn't. Although the Bible doesn’t explicitly have a verse that says “This is 
the law of contradiction, follow it” this doesn’t mean that scripture doesn’t provide a basis for 
therefore, since we can deduce the testimony from scripture. Scripture tells us that God is not a man 
that He should lie *(Num. 23:19)*, thus when God says a proposition is true or false, that same 
proposition can't therefore be true and false at the same time. If God commands us to not commit 
adultery, He isn't saying that we should commit adultery or that we should burn down a forest. 
When St. John says that God is true light and in Him there is no darkness at all *(1 Jn. 1:5)* we can’t 
suppose that God is both true light and true darkness or true darkness and in Him there is no light. 
This quote from Christian philosopher Gordon H. Clark summarizes the relationship between logic 
and scripture as such: *"The laws of logic are the way God thinks. He makes no mistakes, draws no*
*unwarranted conclusions, constructs no invalid arguments. We do, and that is one of the reasons*
*why we are commanded by the Apostle Paul to bring all our thoughts into captivity to Christ. We*
*ought to think as Christ does logically."* All the examples shown thus far have been about mundane
things (excluding the scriptural references) so now let’s see how logic affects our politics.

Typically in nationalist discourse the issue of the non-European history of Christianity is raised within 
the context of delegitimizing Christianity as a religion of foreigners, that being of Jewish people and 
not of historically ethnic Europeans.
When a neo-pagan in any right wing movement thus claims, for example as is commonly raised, that 
the Jews control the media, the banks or Christianity holistically, he is already admitting that 
Christianity is the only true religion, since you won’t find a single line in any of the heathen literature 
claiming that we ought to make use of reason. By claiming that Christianity is Jewish by accusation of 
being foreign he steals from the Christian worldview of which is included a basis for logic.

Secondly it should be noted that when a neopagan makes a moral claim he also doesn’t have any 
basis for that moral claim whatsoever. It is virtually impossible to construct an entire system of 
ethics from the heathen literature which would allow a neopagan to claim that something is good 
when it’s European or bad when it’s foreign. When a neo-pagan claims that the raping of European 
women by migrants (another common accusation blamed on Christianity) is a bad thing, where does 
he get this idea from? Certainly not in any of the heathen literature which is filled with such acts 
from the gods themselves! He’s getting this idea from scripture as seen in *Dt. 22:23-29* where it’s 
explicitly condemned in the law of God, the same system of morality which each man has written on 
his heart *(Rom. 1,2)*. This could also be applied to murder, pornography, theft, cheating, etc.

__In conclusion neopaganism cannot offer a logical worldview or a system of morality.__

## Where does one draw the line of heritage?

Europe has been inhabited by peoples for millennia. Some directly and literally worshipped their 
ancestors as gods, some less exposed tribes were initially monotheistic before joining a larger 
confederation and incorporating their tribal god into their perspective regional pantheon. As is 
clearly seen in the Roman Empire and in Greece, there were countless minor gods and even simple 
men could become heroes and thereby revered as gods. Historians hesitantly admit that Heracles 
must have existed in some way, even if his actions were those of multiple peoples over a large span 
of time as the literal establishment of Greek dynasties and cities were attributed to him.

Would it then be ridiculous to ask if Odin worshippers were traitors to their Sun worshipping 
ancestors? Or if moon worshippers would be traitors to the invocation of Freya? It’s worth noting 
that even in Greek paganism the lack of worship and veneration to certain gods had dire 
consequences for Greek heroes on their adventures, so the idea that there had been, even in Pagan 
times, timeless and outright loyalty to a specific deity is ridiculous

### Myth of belief

As stated before, most of these self-proclaimed neo-pagans are nothing but atheists with a mask on. 
Whenever you have misfortune of being in a conversation with a neo-pagan, ask them: do you really 
believe in x or y? Watch them immediately shrink down and claim whatever you're asking is merely 
"a construct", or "a poetic exposition" and declare that they even quite obviously have no true faith 
in their supposed religion. The author does not don't blame them, unless one would venture to 
believe that Loki, brother of Thor, gave birth to Sleipnir as it is said: Loki had "such dealings" with 
Svaðilfari that "somewhat later" Loki gave birth to a grey foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir, 
"the best horse among gods and men."

*These gods are somehow, in the truest sense of admittance transexuals and zoophiles at the same*
*time.* Paganism, and specifically Scandinavian/Germanic paganism is weak. Tyr, god of war, has his 
hand mauled by a dog, warriors are carried into Valhalla by valkyries, which represent strong women 
warriors, Thor is killed in the end. Everything done by these "gods" is the epitome of weakness and 
the behaviour of degenerates. "Might makes right" is often said by neo-pagans, but with such a 
weak faith, weak gods, and a seemingly weak belief held by their ancestors, they have fallen victim 
of their own favourite phrase.

**In all things we call on the reader to remember the love of our Lord, God and Master Jesus Christ**
**who in His infinite mercy shed His priceless blood for our salvation, in whom we are made new**
**men in the sacrament of Holy Baptism and life-giving faith.**

> 9 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
> 10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
> 11 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
>  *Isaiah 13:9-11*
